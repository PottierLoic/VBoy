It is written in V.  

### Goals:

- [ ] Tile and background visualization  
- [ ] Debugger  

### Future goals:
- [ ] Fast forward and speed change  
- [ ] Backtracking  

## Requirements  

- [V](https://github.com/vlang/v)

## Install / Run  

Don't forget to install the requirements:  [here](#requirements)  

```bash
v run src/ ./path/to/rom.gb
```

## Warning and docs  

VBoy is still in development, not optimized and poorly written.  
This may change in the future, but it is actually not a good emulator example (doesn't even work ^^).  

In case you want to develop one yourself, some websites and softwares are very useful:  
- [Pandocs](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/): contains everything about the Gameboy.  
- [Opcodes](https://www.pastraiser.com/cpu/gameboy/gameboy_opcodes.html): all the Gameboy opcodes and some usefull informations (cycles, flags).  
- [BGB](https://bgb.bircd.org): emulator and debugger, usefull to check results.  

The discord server availlable on pandocs (gbdev) is also a wonderful place to find help.
